Hello! I’m Yangyang Li, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the DGP Program at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, approaching graduation and actively exploring my next opportunity. I study AI for health, with a focus on developing efficient algorithms and deep learning methods for challenging problems in computational biology.

My work sits at the intersection of deep learning, high-performance computing, and bioinformatics, where I build research software and data-driven solutions to translate complex biological data into actionable insights.

This website is a space where I share my experiences, ideas, and resources in programming, deep learning, and AI-driven biomedical research.

A cup of coffee will support me to insist sharing :smile:
