Hello and welcome! I am Yangyang Li, a Ph.D. candidate in the DGP Program at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.
I specialize in developing algorithms and deep learning methods to tackle
challenging biological problems.

Furthermore, I have a fervent passion for harnessing the power of programming languages, such as C++, Rust, and Python, to tackle intricate challenges in Computational Biology.
My journey as a Ph.D. student has afforded me the privilege to engage in pioneering research projects, each of which stretches the limits of our current understanding and holds the promise to effect genuine global impact.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a keen interest in keeping a finger on the pulse of the latest tech industry advancements.
I'm always on the lookout to learn novel programming languages and refine my techniques.
When the rigors of academia don't have me occupied, I'm either immersing myself in fresh side projects or embracing the serenity of the outdoors.

I conceived this website as a platform to relay my experiences, insights, and invaluable resources to fellow enthusiasts in the programming and deep learning realms.
It's my earnest wish that you derive inspiration, knowledge, or even a hint of curiosity from my shared content!

A cup of coffee will support me to insist sharing :smile:
