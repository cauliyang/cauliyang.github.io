## About Me

Hello! I'm **Yangyang Li**, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the DGP Program at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. As I approach graduation, I'm actively exploring opportunities where I can apply my expertise in AI and computational biology to solve real-world challenges.

## Research Focus

My research sits at the intersection of:
- **Deep Learning** - Developing novel neural network architectures for biological data analysis
- **High-Performance Computing** - Building scalable algorithms for large-scale genomic datasets
- **Bioinformatics** - Creating research software that translates complex biological data into actionable insights

I specialize in developing efficient algorithms and deep learning methods for challenging problems in computational biology, particularly in genomic interval analysis and AI-driven biomedical research.

## This Blog

This website serves as a platform where I share:
- Technical tutorials and guides on AI, programming, and bioinformatics
- Research insights and computational methods
- Development resources and best practices
- Learning experiences in deep learning and software engineering

Whether you're a researcher, developer, or student, I hope you find valuable resources here.
