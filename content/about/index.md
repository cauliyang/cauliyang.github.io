Hi there! My name is Yangyang Li, and I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the DGP Program at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

I'm passionate about developing algorithm and using programming languages like C++, Rust, and Python to solve complex problems in the field of Computational Biology.
As a Ph.D. student, I have the opportunity to work on exciting research projects that push the boundaries of what we know and have the potential to make a real impact in the world.

In addition to my studies and research, I enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest developments in the tech industry and learning new programming languages and techniques.
When I'm not busy with school or work, you can find me tinkering with new projects or exploring the outdoors.
I started this website as a way to share my experiences, insights, and resources with others who are interested in programming and deep learning.
I hope you'll find something helpful or interesting here!

A cup of coffee will support me to insist sharing :smile:
