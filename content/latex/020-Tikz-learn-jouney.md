## Why

Welcome to 'My TikZ-Learning Journey', a space where I document my exploration with the wonderful TikZ library in LaTeX.
LaTeX is a typesetting system used widely in academia and industries for the production of scientific and technical documents.
Of its many features, the one I've recently been fascinated with is the TikZ library - a versatile package for crafting detailed and professional-grade diagrams.

This [open-source repository][repo] is more than just a personal notebook.
It's an arena where I intend to share my collection of TikZ codes with you all.
This collection, which will gradually expand, is not just about sharing the product of my learning process but about giving you an insight into my journey of learning and experimenting with TikZ.

Whether you are a beginner just starting out with LaTeX and TikZ, or an experienced user searching for a fresh perspective, I hope my shared learning path will inspire and assist you.

## What is TikZ?

TikZ is a higher-level drawing language built on top of the LaTeX document preparation system.
It allows the creation of complex, beautiful graphics, all in the heart of LaTeX.
Despite its power, TikZ can be daunting to learn due to its comprehensive nature.
From creating simple geometrical figures to developing intricate diagrams such as flowcharts, network diagrams, or logic circuits, TikZ provides the tools for us to implement our imagination in a precise, structured manner.

## What can you expect from this repository?

This repository is intended to be a living testament to my learning journey.
As I delve deeper into the intricacies of TikZ, I'll be documenting and sharing my codes, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them.
You can expect to see the evolution of my work from simple drawings to intricate, multifaceted diagrams.

While I'll try to annotate my code and explain my thought process wherever possible, please bear in mind that this project is primarily a reflection of my self-directed learning.
It isn't structured as a course or guide.
However, I do believe that by seeing the practical application of TikZ commands and observing how they can be manipulated to generate diverse outputs, you'll gain valuable insights and understanding of TikZ.

I encourage you all to experiment with the shared codes, tweak them, and make them your own.
By sharing my journey, I aim to inspire you to embark on your own exploration of TikZ and LaTeX.

## Join me in this journey

As we navigate the complexities of learning TikZ together, we'll inevitably stumble, err, and grow.
Remember, this learning journey isn't about perfection.
It's about the experience of trying, learning, and improving.
With that in mind, I warmly invite you to join me on this adventure of understanding and mastering TikZ in LaTeX.

Let's dive into the fascinating world of technical diagrams together, one line of code at a time.
