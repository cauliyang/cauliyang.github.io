## What is LunarVim

- [Lunarvim]

_Lunarvim_ is a comprehensive configuration of Neovim, and It gives you full-profile IDE developed experience!
I cannot live without it ðŸš€! Currently, I am big fans of Lunarvim and customize
my personal development environment based on it. I already write another blog
to talk about how I build personal development environment.

Lunarvim is a fork of Neovim that aims to provide a more user-friendly experience out of the box, with a curated set of plugins and configurations that make it easier to get started with Neovim.
It's highly customizable and offers a range of features, including fuzzy file searching, built-in LSP support, and easy plugin management.

Lunarvim is a great choice if you're interested in Neovim's functionality but don't want to spend as much time customizing it.
Its curated set of plugins and configurations make it easier to get started with, while still providing the power and flexibility of Neovim.
It's also a great choice if you're interested in using Neovim for coding in a terminal, as it provides a range of features that make that experience more user-friendly.

The transition from a text editor to an integrated development environment (IDE) can be a significant one.
While text editors like Neovim provide powerful tools for editing code, IDEs like JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse provide a more complete development environment, with features like debugging, refactoring, and version control built in.
However, for those who are already using Neovim and are familiar with its keybindings and customizability, the transition to an IDE may not be necessary or desirable.
Neovim is a highly customizable editor that can be configured to provide many of the features of an IDE, such as code completion, syntax highlighting, and plugins for integrating with source control systems.
To create a personal development environment (PDE) in Neovim, you can start by customizing your editor's settings to your preferences.

This can involve setting up keybindings, changing the color scheme, and configuring plugins to provide additional functionality like code formatting or auto-completion.
You may also want to consider using a plugin manager like Vim-Plug or Pathogen to easily install and manage plugins.
These plugins can provide additional functionality like integration with linters or code formatters, which can help you write better code more efficiently.

Another important aspect of a PDE is version control.
Neovim provides built-in support for many source control systems, including Git and Mercurial.
By integrating your editor with your source control system, you can easily manage your codebase and collaborate with others.
Overall, whether you choose to use an IDE or stick with a text editor like Neovim, creating a personalized development environment can help you get the most out of your coding experience.
By customizing your editor to your needs and preferences, you can improve your productivity and enjoy a more streamlined and efficient workflow.
