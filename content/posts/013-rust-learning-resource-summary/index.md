## 1. Why learning Rust?

Well, I guess you may have heard about someone talked about [Rust].
To be clear, I am not fans of certain programming language, and I do not interest to argue which one is best as well.
I am sure every programming language will have their own applications setting.
Before I tried [Rust], I am a guy who heavily use [C++], more specifically **Modern C++**, and [Python].
To be honest, I do not like [C++] too much as I am not smart guy to master it.
I am attracted by [Rust] when I first know about it.
It owns same high performance as C/C++ but strict compiler.
It uses special idea to help you control your program.
Why not to try it!
