The library is a collection of algorithms and data structures that are designed for modern C++ bioinformatics applications.
You can use the library in your own projects or as a part of a larger project.

The library will include efficient data structure and algorithm implemented by Modern C++.

**The design philosophy of the library:**

- Embrace C++20 standard
- Supports modern C++ features
- Support concurrency and thread safety
- Priority is given to safety and clean design
- Hard to use wrongly
- Testing extensively
- Python bindings
-

The current project is developing and evolving, and changes will be made to the library as time goes on.
