Config Compile Environment I am preparing to develop a tool using C++ in the Linux and macOS environments. Usually, I do not have root rights to download dependencies for C++ using apt-get install -y denpendencies directly in Ubuntu. However, I usually feel frustrated when the dependency chain is complicated. That means I need to download and compile every library I use. This may cost you one night or even one week.","tags":["Develop"],"title":"Guide for building Cpp Development in Bioinformatics"},{"date":"2021-12-03","image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cauliyang/blog-image@main//img/logo.png","imageAlt":"","link":"https://cauliyang.github.io/posts/001-a-wonderful-library-you-must-not-know/","summary":"A toolbox including a batch of useful commands for annoying tasks.","tags":["Develop","Python"],"title":"A Python Toolbox - Pybox"},{"date":"2021-04-04","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://cauliyang.github.io/posts/010-pca-by-python/","summary":"This article records two methods of PCA analysis using Python, and visualizes 2-dimensional results.","tags":["Machine Learning","Python"],"title":"PCA by Python"},{"date":"2019-04-03","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://cauliyang.github.io/posts/008-nei-saitou-neighbor-joining/","summary":"one of my homework that requires me to implement Nei-Saitou Neighbor Joining algorithm to construct phylogenetic tree, as well as evaluating the bootstrap cconfidence","tags":["Algorithm","Bioinformatics"],"title":"Nei Saitou Neighbor Joining"}],"test":"Begin to Learn Rust!
