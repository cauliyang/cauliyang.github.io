You can use the library in your own projects or as a part of a larger project.
The library will include efficient data structure and algorithm implemented by Modern C++.
The design philosophy of the library:
Embrace C++20 standard Supports modern C++ features Support concurrency and thread safety Priority is given to safety and clean design Hard to use wrongly Testing extensively Python bindings The current project is developing and evolving, and changes will be made to the library as time goes on.</description></item><item><title>Bioinformatics Toolbox Aka Boss</title><link>https://yangyangli.top/posts/009-new-tool-bioinformatics-toolbox-aka-boss/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2022 23:22:31 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yangyangli.top/posts/009-new-tool-bioinformatics-toolbox-aka-boss/</guid><description>BOSS is a bioinformatics toolbox, which will contain efficient tools. It is written in modern C++ and is tested exhaustively. It is designed to be easy to use and time-efficient. BOSS is a free software and is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License V3.
Currently, BOSS contains the following tools:
boss-fqsp : A fast tool for splitting fastq files into paired files. boss-squeue: Summary Status of Jobs in HPC Queues It is now evolving and will be updated frequently.</description></item><item><title>Nei Saitou Neighbor Joining</title><link>https://yangyangli.top/posts/008-nei-saitou-neighbor-joining/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 11:15:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://yangyangli.top/posts/008-nei-saitou-neighbor-joining/</guid><description>1. Background Before diving into code, the description of NJ algorithm can be found in , where first column indicates parent node, and second column is its children node, the last column is the value of edge.
2. Neighbor Joining Algorithm The Neighbor-joining Algorithm Given a distance matrix d compute an uprooted tree topology complete with edge lengths that tries to preserve the additive property: $d_{i,m} + d_{j,m} âˆ’ d_{i,j} = 2d_{k,m}$ where $k$ is the k-th node on both routes from $i$ and $j$ to $m$.</description></item></channel></rss>
