You can use the library in your own projects or as a part of a larger project.
The library will include efficient data structure and algorithm implemented by Modern C++.
The design philosophy of the library:
Embrace C++20 standard Supports modern C++ features Support concurrency and thread safety Priority is given to safety and clean design Hard to use wrongly Testing extensively Python bindings The current project is developing and evolving, and changes will be made to the library as time goes on.</description></item></channel></rss>
