Introduction Many people have been asking for a toolbox of useful commands for their everyday tasks. I also want to build a toolbox for my own use, and I want to make it as easy as possible to use. Hence, I decided to build this project, which may be a valuable tool for other people as well. I will add more commands to this toolbox once I find them useful in the future.</description></item><item><title>PCA by Python</title><link>https://yangyangli.top/posts/010-pca-by-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2021 23:58:37 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://yangyangli.top/posts/010-pca-by-python/</guid><description>1. Introduction 1.1 What&amp;rsquo;s PCA? When it comes to methods of reducing dimension, PCA that is an unsupervised linear transformation technique, must be not ignored. Moreover, if you want to know the subtle relationships among data set and reduce the computational complexity in downstream analysis, the PCA may be your best choice! Meanwhile, if you would like to present your data in a 2-dimension or 3-dimension coordinate system, and PCA would sweep your problems!</description></item></channel></rss>
